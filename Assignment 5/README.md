# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Overview 

### Purpose
Low fidelity prototypes are created due to how quick and rapid representation of a user flow/product. It allows for UX designers to recieve feedback and allows them to make changes before time and money are put into the product. Lo-Fi prototypes are usually created through hand-drawn sketches and allows for the designer to maximize the amount of improvements before further work is done. Through making low fidelity prototypes, I will be able to understand what features I want to prioritize in my app. In addition, I can recieve quick feedback from user testers before I create my more advanced high fidelity prototype. 

### Personas and Scenarios
My first persona is Karina Lu, a smart and outgoing college student that does not have time for a cluttered social media feed. 
My second persona is Claire Smith, a busy and organized mom of three who wants to stay in touch with her busy children that are either in school or abroad doing work. 

### Tasks
I will be focusing on: 
1. Creating an update post
2. Streaming a movie with others

## Wireframes and Flow
### Creating a post

## Reflection/Summary
I enjoyed creating the hand-drawn Lo-Fi designs as this was my first time creating wireframes. Drawing each interaction and connecting the flow definitely made me realize the effort UX designers put into creating good transition/flows that are intuitive for the users. While drawing the sketches, I had to research what common icons UX designers use in order to make my app universal. Even though I had an idea of what sort of designs I wanted, putting the designs to paper was a lot more challenging than I thought. 

From the user testing, I believe I am on track to understanding which features to prioritze. But I need to work on the home page the most. My user told me that this specific page needs the most work on spacing. This is a sentiment I agree on since I do have some negative space in some of my pages. In addition, I was only able to ask one person to walk through my wireframe. In the future, I would like to have more users go through my designs to have a wider range of perspectives and opinions.

Overall, I believe that this assignment helped me apply what we learned about wireframes during class. Also, it made me more excited when I will create a proper prototype as I will be able to see my ideas transferred from paper to a screen.
