# Assignment 5: Low Fidelity Prototype

## Overview 

### Purpose
Low fidelity prototypes are created due to how quick and rapid representation of a user flow/product. It allows for UX designers to recieve feedback and allows them to make changes before time and money are put into the product. Lo-Fi prototypes are usually created through hand-drawn sketches and allows for the designer to maximize the amount of improvements before further work is done. Through making low fidelity prototypes, I will be able to understand what features I want to prioritize in my app. In addition, I can recieve quick feedback from user testers before I create my more advanced high fidelity prototype. 

### Personas and Scenarios
My first persona is Karina Lu, a smart and outgoing college student that does not have time for a cluttered social media feed. 
My second persona is Claire Smith, a busy and organized mom of three who wants to stay in touch with her busy children that are either in school or abroad doing work. 

### Tasks
I will be focusing on: 
1. Creating an update post
2. Playing a game with others
3. Streaming a movie with others
