# DH110 Spring 2023
This space is for my UX project about family. 
I want to create an app/website that allows family members to connect and share their interests with each other such as current tv shows and movies they have watched.

# Assignment 1 - Britney Lam 
## Tentative Title: Let's Stay Linked
Living at school, I find it a little difficult to stay connected with both my immediate and extended family members. As I have gotten older, I understand how hard it is to find the time to communicate with family throughout my busy day. Though I may not be able to call them or have extensive messages, I would love to know what new hobbies they're up to, new music and films they're enjoying, and new life updates. While there are existing apps that have these aspects, I want to contribute with this UX project by creating an app or website that is accessible for every family member regardless of technological capability. In addition, these aspects that I mentioned above (tv, music, etc) would have a dedicated section within the app or website.

In this assignment, I will be conducting two heuristic evaluations using the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design and providing severity ratings as well. 

## Severity Ratings for Usability Problems - Nielson Norman 
| Ratings | Description |
| --| ------------- |
| 0 | I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all  |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority              |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority              |

## 1. Visibility of System Status   
The website/app informs the user of the current status of what is happening and what actions they are taking in a timely manner.

The website tells you at the top of the page which family group you are in. In addition, at the top of the left side bar, it clearly states that you are logged in with the correct profile. When you create a post, it immediately alert you whether or not it has successfully been posted on the feed. (0)

*Improvements:
No recommendations for improvement.*

## 2. Match Between Systems and the Real World
The website/app should be utilizing words and presenting concepts in a way that mirrors real-life. 

The website uses common real-life phrases such as "Calender", "Budget", and "Recipe Box". However, on the feed page it gives the option of ordering posts by "creation date" and "update date". These two phrases may be confusing for users to differentiate them. (2)

*Improvements:
"Creative Date" should be changed to "Upload Date".*

## 3. User Control and Freedom 
The website/app allows users to easily undo or delete an option. 

The site easily allows users to delete an accidental post or submission. For example, if an individual accidentally posted a photo and wanted to delete it. The user can go to the vertical ellipsis next to the photo and click on the trash icon. If the user wanted to delete or edit an item off the To-Do list, they would have to hover their cursor over the item in order to see the trash and pencil icon. (2)

*Improvements:
Add a horizontal ellipsis to indicate that users can perform an action.*


## 4. Consistency and Standards 
The website/app words, phrases, and actions aligns with conventions that other websites also use.

The menu is located on the left side of the screen. And there are three horizontal lines at the top left of the screen, indicating that the menu is collapsable. In addition, after collapsing the menu bar, there are universal icons for users to still click on and identify. By clicking on the FamilyWall icon at the top left of the screen, it relocates the user to the home page. It may be difficult for technologically challenged users to naviagate the menu bar from the side of the page instead of using navigating these options from the top of the screen. (2)

*Improvements:
Move the FamilyWall icon that takes users to the home page in the middle of the screen. In addition, move the group icon to the left of the screen.*

## 5. Error Prevention
The website/app should prevent errors from occurring and check with users using confirmation. 

When writing an update, the website notifys if the user has spelled a word incorrectly. However, there is no spelling and grammar check options. In addition, there is no option to save a draft of my post if I wanted to go back to writing my post. (3)

*Improvements: Add a pop up message features that the users draft will not be saved for the future.*

## 6. Recognition Rather than Recall 
The website/app makes information easily accessible without have to remember an icons. 

The side navigation bar is collapsable. When collapsed, each tab has universal icons. The user does not have to hover over the navigation bar. (0)

*Improvements: No recommendations for improvement.*

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use 
The website/app has processes and shortcuts that allow novice users to become experts.

When users what to comment on someone's post, there is a GIF and Emoji icon for individuals to easily pick out either. There are no keyboard shortcuts available for when you are updating your feed.(2)

*Improvements: Add more options for written updates such as text-to-speech. In addition, pictures should have alternate text to make the platform more accessible.*

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Website/app should not contain irrelevant information. 

The side navigation bar has many tabs/icons. This may be overwhelming for users who are novice at using technology. Also, there are tabs that are only availble for premium users but embedded within the side navigation bar with the free options as well. (3)

*Improvements: Tabs should be combined. For example, "Timetables" and "Calendar" can be merged together since both of their purposes are about scheduling and events. Premium tabs should have an additional icon, such as a star, so the user isn't left unsatisfied and confused.*

## 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
The website/app should display error messages using plain language. 

If the user enters the wrong password or email, its "Check your username or password" in a red bar. It does not let users know whether the email or password they put in is incorrect. (1)

*Improvements: Notify users whether their inputted email or password is incorrect.*

## 10. Help and Documentation
Website/app should have easily accessible help pages. 

There is no help tab on the side navigation bar. There is the word "support" at the bottom of the page. It is written in a very small font and is off-centered. (3)

*Improvements: Instead of "support" it should be the word "help". Also, it should be added to the side navigation bar for easy accessibility.*

***Overall, I believe that this website can be easily used for all individuals. However, some major changes such as the side tab overload and "help" page need to be improved in order for the user to smoothly navigate the website.***

## b) Marco Polo

## 1. Visibility of System Status   
The website/app informs the user of the current status of what is happening and what actions they are taking in a timely manner.

The user can see what page of the app they are on by looking at the bottom of the screen. There are three icons: a house, an avatar, and a gear. When on the home page, users can clearly see their separate messages and which individuals they are chatting with. In addition, you are able to see the name of group chats. (2)

*Improvements: Icons that indicate which page the users are on should be at the top of the screen for easy viewing.*

## 2. Match Between Systems and the Real World
The website/app should be utilizing words and presenting concepts in a way that mirrors real-life. 

The tabs such as "Contacts" and "Suggested" on the home page are universally used. The icons used at the bottom of the screen easily reflect what they represent. However, the tab option "Advanced" in the settings page can be confusing since it is a vague term. The "Advanced" option contains: Privacy mode, Background Listening, Microphone, and Bluetooth options. (2)

*Improvements: Rename this tab to "Sounds" or "Audio".

## 3. User Control and Freedom 
The website/app allows users to easily undo or delete an option.

If the user changed their mind about sending an invite, they can click the "cancel" button. However, there is no option to delete a message. In the upper right hand corner, there is a pencil icon. This gives an impression that you can edit the message you sent. But, this icon is to give the user a "scratchpad" so they can jot down notes for when you record messsages. (3)

*Improvements: Add an option that users can edit the video messages that they send. In addition, change the scratchpad icon or put this option at bottom of the screen to not confuse the user.*

## 4. Consistency and Standards 
The website/app words, phrases, and actions aligns with conventions that other websites also use.

The app uses common phrases that is consistent with other websites/apps such as "Contacts" and "Suggested". In addition, universally known icons (house, avatar, and gear) are utilized. But the panel to control which page you are on is at the bottom of the screen. Also, there is no sign out that is usually in the settings of many websites and apps. There is a section called "Bookmarked Polos" where users can bookmark certain videos. While this phrase is relevant to the app name it can be confusing for users to understand what this is, requiring them to research it. When clicking on the vertical ellipsis next to a chat on the home page, the option "Set Chat Tile" is available. This is feature is for users to set profile photos for the people they are chatting with. It is confusing as this phrase is not common in other chat apps or websites. (3)

*Improvements: Move the panel to the top of the app to be more consistent with other website/apps. This will help the user be more comfortable with using the app, especially if it is their first time. Include a sign out option in the "Settings". Change "Bookedmarked Polos" to "Favorited" or "Saved". Change "Set Chat Tile" to "Add Profile Picture" instead.* 

## 5. Error Prevention
The website/app should prevent errors from occurring and check with users using confirmation. 

The app underlines words spelled incorrectly and sometimes self-corrects the misspelled words. When typing a message or creating a video, the app does not let you create drafts and deletes what you have created already (2).

*Improvements: Committ to just underlining misspelled words because spellcheck may try to correct words, such as names, when they are not incorrect in the first place. Add a draft option.*

## 6. Recognition Rather than Recall 
The website/app makes information easily accessible without have to remember an icons.

The app allows users to add their contacts into Marco Polo and even has suggestions on who they should invite into the app. (0)

*Improvements: No recommendations for improvement.*

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use 
The website/app has processes and shortcuts that allow novice users to become experts.

The app allows users to access their contacts through the app and easily invite them through a pre-copied link. In addition, they have a section where it has "Suggested" contacts that the users should invite to expand their network. (0)

*Improvements: No recommendations for improvement.*

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
Website/app should not contain irrelevant information. 

Most of the information presented on the app is essential to the goal of video chatting messages. The interface is very simple with legible font and a white background. After clicking on the veritcal ellipsis on a specific group/person you are chatting with, it presents you with 5-6 options depending if you input the group/individual to have a photo. There are too many options available, leading to the user feeling possibly overwhelmed. In addition, the "Start a Group" and "Add _ to Plus Family" are unneccessary. Also, the "block" and "delete" options are combined into one which could lead to mistakes. (3)

*Improvements: Decrease the amount of options available for each chat. Separate the block and delete options.*

## 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
The website/app should display error messages using plain language. 

If the user types in an invalid phone number, an error message immediately pops up and explains that it is invalid and asks for the user to try again. (0)

*Improvements: No recommendations for improvement.*

## 10. Help and Documentation
Website/app should have easily accessible help pages.

The "Help" page can be accessed through the Settings Page and has its own defined tab. After clicking the "Help" tab, the "FAQs", "Accessibility", and "Contact Us" pages can be seen. (0)

*Improvements: No recommendations for improvement.*

***Overall: The intention of the app is very useful for busy individuals but some major changes have to occurr in order for users to have a smooth and easy experience navigating the app and doing simple tasks such as signing out. The major changes that should occur are mainly seen in User Control and Freedom and Consistency and Standards.***
