# DH110 Assignment 2 Pilot Usability Testing by Britney Lam

## Introduction
**FamilyWall**  is an app/website that aims to help users create a network of close family and friends. Within the app, individuals can privately communicate with their loved ones. They can access a private cloud, exchange message and photos, share contacts, organize events, and see locations. In addition, this app offers users premium features such as budgeting, meal planning, timetables, and audio/video messaging. 

## Purpose of Pilot Usability Testing (UT)
The purpose of pilot usability testing is to improve the user experience of the app/website and find the weaknesses that can be corrected. By recruiting even just a few individuals in a usability testing, the apps's design flaws can be discovered. This can alleviate future issues without having to spend a large amount of resources to finding these mistakes. UT is also a good method to understanding the thought process and behaviors of participants and to see how a first-time consumer would navigate the app. Overall, the goal of UT is to evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction of the product.

## Methodology 

In the tasks I created for the UT, I focused on the Consistency and Standards, User Control and Freedom, and Help and Documentation heuristics because I found these componenets most problematic when I initially evaluated the website. For Consistency and Standards, I found it nonintuitive that the icon to create a group chat and to add members is at the top of the screen even though all the other icons on the website are located to the left of the site. For Task 1, I will ask the user to create an account and to invite at least two contacts. Next, for User Control and Freedom, a user would have to hover their cursor over the item in the To-Do list. I believe it would improve the user experience if ellipses were added to indicate that the user could peform the action. For Task 2, I will ask the user to create an item on the To-Do list, go back and edit it, and to check if this update is confirmed. Lastly, the Help and Documentation heuristic for FamilyLife is a major change that needs to be made due to the Help page being difficult to find. Task 3 will ask the user to go to the Help page, access the FAQ, and find the the price of a premium membership.

The usability test will be conducted in my room, a quiet place that will be suitable for this study. I will be using my Macbook Air Laptop and having Zoom be my video-recording platform. 

The user and I will sit next to each other for the entirety of the UT. I will be telling the user about background information and consent rights. The user will be completing the consent, pre-test, post-test, tasks, SUS, product satisfaction, and demographic sections.

## Reflection

Overall, the UT went very smoothly. The user was able to complete Tasks 1 and 2 very easily. Despite my previous critiques of these heuristics that the first two tasks are correlated with, the user presented no struggle. The user did expectedly struggle for Task 3. During the time I was creating my evaluation and questions, there was a very small button at the bottom of the site that said "support". However, when the user tried finding where the "Help" section is the "support" button was gone all together. During Task 3, the user was evidently struggling with finding where the "Help" section would be, leading her to have to find another method to finding where the price of the premium membership is. She ultimately could not find the FAQ page. The user's experience with Task 3 confirmed how I believed it was a major issue of the website. This issue continues to be emphasized as she responded that she would be "somewhat likely" to go to the "Help" page.

I believe that this user was a great participant for this UT because her technical skills are middle ground as she is neither very advanced or uneducated about using technology. Despite Task 3, she considered her experience with FamilyWall to be "calm, familiar, innovative, professional, and trustworthy. Overall, I believe that this experience was very beneficial as I was able to witness a participant using the website for the very first time. I was able to truly see their perspective and thought process while answering the tasks and navigating the website.
