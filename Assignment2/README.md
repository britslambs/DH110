# DH110 Assignment 2 Pilot Usability Testing by Britney Lam

## Introduction
**FamilyWall**  is an app/website that aims to help users create a network of close family and friends. Within the app, individuals can privately communicate with their loved ones. They can access a private cloud, exchange message and photos, share contacts, organize events, and see locations. In addition, this app offers users premium features such as budgeting, meal planning, timetables, and audio/video messaging. 

## Purpose of Pilot Usability Testing (UT)
The purpose of pilot usability testing is to improve the user experience of the app/website and find the weaknesses that can be corrected. By recruiting even just a few individuals in a usability testing, the apps's design flaws can be discovered. This can alleviate future issues without having to spend a large amount of resources to finding these mistakes. UT is also a good method to understanding the thought process and behaviors of participants and to see how a first-time consumer would navigate the app.
