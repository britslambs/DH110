# Pitch and Portfolio

# DH110 Project: Branches - Britney Lam

## Introduction
For this quarter's DH110 class theme, Professor Cho announced that we would be focused on family. As a college student who lives far from her family, I wanted to created an app that allows you to have a dedicated, private space where you share updates, play games, and stream movies. I chose these specific features because I found that myself and others around me focus on activities when we communicate with our family. 

## Design Statement
To do the previous listed activities, I usually have to switch between multiple apps/platforms. I find this inconvenient, especially because I do not have much free time due to schoolwork and extracurriculars. Therefore, this app needed to be easy to navigate and versatile. I believe that this app can benefit many people of all demographics since users want to reach their goals in the least amount of time. In addition, when people are on social media, they usually follow individuals outside of their family, such as friends and celebrities, therefore, this app is designed to be family-centric. Even if a user does not have time to scroll through social media, they can utilize this app since it cuts back on clutter. 

## Competitor Analysis 
### Heuristics 
I conducted a heuristics analysis of the Family Wall and Marco Polo apps based off of Neilson's heuristic ratings. I chose these apps as these are two popular platforms created to communicate with family through video chatting and direct messaging. Family Wall not only allows basic features like chatting but also shared grocery lists, schedules, and locations through purchasing the Premium membership. Marco Polo focused on video chatting and sending live messages ...[Read more](https://github.com/britslambs/DH110/tree/main/Assignment01)

### Usability Testing
The primary objective of pilot usability testing is to enhance the user experience of the application or website and identify any areas of weakness that can be rectified. By engaging a small number of individuals in usability testing, the design flaws of the app can be uncovered. This approach enables the detection of potential issues early on, without requiring a significant investment of resources. Additionally, usability testing is a valuable method for gaining insights into the thought processes and behaviors of participants, as well as observing how a first-time user would navigate the app. I conducted my pilot UT with Margaret using the FamilyWall app ...

## User Research
The significance of user research lies is to enhance the user experience of a product or service by identifying and addressing weaknesses. By conducting user research, design flaws can be uncovered and fixed, preventing future issues and minimizing resources wasted. Furthermore, user research allows for a deeper understanding of participants' thoughts, behaviors, and preferences, enabling the creation of more intuitive and user-friendly experiences. I conducted user research with Alex by giving him two tasks that relate to my proposed features of my app ...

## UX Storytelling
Storytelling allows you to step into the position of the user and keeps the design user-centric. It ensures that the design is focused on the users' needs and valuable towards making their lives easier. Designers can create an emotional connection with the user as they map out their problems, goals, and resolutions. Drawing from my user research, I created two personas: Claire Smith, a working mom of three, and Karina Lu, a busy college student...

## Wireframe and Graphic Design
The purpose of this design is to create a minimalistic interface for my app idea: Branches. It is a family-centric app that aims to maintain and grow close relationships, even from a distance. In this app, families can chat, video call, post updates, play games, and stream movies together. I chose to design the home page of the app that shows updates from family members and icons at the bottom of the screen which can lead you to the other features previously mentioned. My design process started off with my hand-drawn low-fidelity prototypes and refining them when I started creating the interface on Figma. I created various typographic, shape, and color variations for potential app designs...

## Low Fidelity Prototype
Low fidelity prototypes are created due to how quick and rapid representation of a user flow/product. It allows for UX designers to recieve feedback and allows them to make changes before time and money are put into the product. Lo-Fi prototypes are usually created through hand-drawn sketches and allows for the designer to maximize the amount of improvements before further work is done. Through making low fidelity prototypes, I will be able to understand what features I want to prioritize in my app. In addition, I can recieve quick feedback from user testers before I create my more advanced high fidelity prototype ...

## High Fidelity Prototype
This high-fidelity, interactive prototype involved several processes. Firstly, I based my wireflow off of my hand-drawn, low-fidelity wireframes. After evaluating my inital designs again, I might slight changes, mainly in the placement of my button features to make the flow more intuitive for users. In addition to my re-designs, I used the plug-in AutoFlow to map out how I would want to create my prototype flows. Then, after creating my prototypes, I entered the user-testing stage. The user was able to give valuable insight on ease of task, stylization and formatting of app, and the overall look and feel of the design. Therefore, I was able to take these critiques and revise my prototypes ...

## Evaluation/Revision
After creating my Hi-Fi prototypes, I had my user Alex critique them and walk me through the tasks from perspective. Below are the user testing videos for each task.

#### Post-Class Cognitive Walkthrough Revisions: 
*After participating in the in-class cognitive walkthrough, I made a couple of changes based off of the suggestions of my groupmates. This is specific to Task 1 since they focused their critiques on this. The following changes are:* 
* Deleted extra page before "Confirm" post to avoid repetition and confusion
* Added drop shadow to selected image for user to clearly see which photo has been chosen
* Added cancel buttons on the pages for users to easily end the process of posting an update
* Added a location arrow and "You are here" for user to see what location they choosing

## Conclusion
Overall, I found this project difficult yet rewarding. This was my first time creating a proper UX project, from brainstorming app designs to creating interactive prototypes on Figma. I believe I was able to create a useful app for two of my personas. Throughout multiple assignments, I recieved feeback from users and classmates, helping me refine my design ideas and gain the perspective of potential users. Therefore, I was able to experience the iterative design process first-hand. My main takeaway from this project is to always listen to users and find as many people to test your wireframes and prototypes. It was very helpful for me because I struggled with understanding the perspective of users at times. 

I sought inspiration from Facebook, WatchParty, and Twitch in the beginning but then started going on my own route as I started receiving feedback. If I were to continue this project, I would definitely want to continue working on my interface design. While what I currently have is not bad, I would like to be more creative. Next, I also want to test my prototypes with a wider demographic and more participants. Although I made multiple revisions, I still think I could improve my app design through refining the layout and button placement.
