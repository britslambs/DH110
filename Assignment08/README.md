# DH110 Project: Branches - Britney Lam

I chose these specific features because I found that myself and others around me focus on activities when we communicate with our family. 

## Design Statement
To do the previous listed activities, I usually have to switch between multiple apps/platforms.

In addition, when people are on social media, they usually follow individuals outside of their family, such as friends and celebrities, therefore, this app is designed to be family-centric. Even if a user does not have time to scroll through social media, they can utilize this app since it cuts back on clutter.

I chose these apps as these are two popular platforms created to communicate with family through video chatting and direct messaging. Family Wall not only allows basic features like chatting but also shared grocery lists, schedules, and locations through purchasing the Premium membership. Marco Polo focused on video chatting and sending live messages ...[Read more](https://github.com/britslambs/DH110/tree/main/Assignment01)

#### Post-Class Cognitive Walkthrough Revisions: 
*After participating in the in-class cognitive walkthrough, I made a couple of changes based off of the suggestions of my groupmates. This is specific to Task 1 since they focused their critiques on this. The following changes are:* 
* Deleted extra page before "Confirm" post to avoid repetition and confusion
* Added drop shadow to selected image for user to clearly see which photo has been chosen
* Added cancel buttons on the pages for users to easily end the process of posting an update
* Added a location arrow and "You are here" for user to see what location they choosing
