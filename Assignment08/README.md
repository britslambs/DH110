#### Post-Class Cognitive Walkthrough Revisions: 
*After participating in the in-class cognitive walkthrough, I made a couple of changes based off of the suggestions of my groupmates. This is specific to Task 1 since they focused their critiques on this. The following changes are:* 
* Deleted extra page before "Confirm" post to avoid repetition and confusion
* Added drop shadow to selected image for user to clearly see which photo has been chosen
* Added cancel buttons on the pages for users to easily end the process of posting an update
* Added a location arrow and "You are here" for user to see what location they choosing
