# DH110
This space is for my UX project about family. 
I want to create an app/website that allows family members to connect and share their interests with each other such as current tv shows and movies they have watched.

# Assignment 1 - Britney Lam 
## Tentative Title: Let's Stay Linked
Living at school, I find it a little difficult to stay connected with both my immediate and extended family members. As I have gotten older, I understand how hard it is to find the time to communicate with family throughout my busy day. Though I may not be able to call them or have extensive messages, I would love to know what new hobbies they're up to, new music and films they're enjoying, and new life updates. While there are existing apps that have these aspects, I want to contribute with this UX project by creating an app or website that is accessible for every family member regardless of technological capability. In addition, these aspects that I mentioned above (tv, music, etc) would have a dedicated section within the app or website.

In this assignment, I will be conducting two heuristic evaluations using the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design and providing severity ratings as well. 

## Severity Ratings for Usability Problems - Nielson Norman 
| Ratings | Description |
| --| ------------- |
| 0 | I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all  |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority              |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority              |

## 1. Visibility of System Status   
The website/app informs the user of the current status of what is happening and what actions they are taking in a timely manner.

#### Good: 
The website tells you at the top of the page which family group you are in. 

#### Good: 

In addition, at the top of the left side bar, it clearly states that you are logged in with the correct profile.

#### Good: 
When you create a post, it immediately alert you whether or not it has successfully been posted on the feed. 

### Improvements
No recommendations for improvement.
