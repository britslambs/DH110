# DH110
This space is for my UX project about family. 
I want to create an app/website that allows family members to connect and share their interests with each other such as current tv shows and movies they have watched.

# Assignment 1 - Britney Lam 
## Tentative Title: Let's Stay Linked
Living at school, I find it a little difficult to stay connected with both my immediate and extended family members. As I have gotten older, I understand how hard it is to find the time to communicate with family throughout my busy day. Though I may not be able to call them or have extensive messages, I would love to know what new hobbies they're up to, new music and films they're enjoying, and new life updates. While there are existing apps that have these aspects, I want to contribute with this UX project by creating an app or website that is accessible for every family member regardless of technological capability. In addition, these aspects that I mentioned above (tv, music, etc) would have a dedicated section within the app or website.

In this assignment, I will be conducting two heuristic evaluations using the 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design and providing severity ratings as well. 

## Severity Ratings for Usability Problems - Nielson Norman 
| Ratings | Description |
| --| ------------- |
| 0 | I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all  |
| 1 | Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project  |
| 2 | Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority              |
| 3 | Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority              |

## Competitor 1: Connect.Family 
*About*

Connect.Family is an app that aims to help users create a private network made up of close friends and family members. Individuals can create family trees and input their geographic locations to notify you when added users in your private network are nearby. In addition, video chatting and messaging are availble. Users can also send requests to suggest plans in which you can accept or deny.
