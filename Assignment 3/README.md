This space is for my UX project about family. 


  
# Step 1: Specify the Research Goal & Requirements  ✔️
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity my project would support for the users is being able to connect with family members beyond messaging. This would mean that they would be able to share an interest(s) of their choice. For example, if one family chose music or movies as their interest, they could share recommendations and live stream the song or movie with each other.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
A basic need that is involved for the activity is belonging/love. Because this app this made for family members or close individuals, users would be able to bond and feel deep connections with the people they love. While people can text or call each other, this app allows them to keep updated with all of their loved ones despite varying schedules. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Traditional/current solutions to statisfy these needs are social media apps such as Instagram and Facebook. Users are able to search and follow/friend users. By doing so, they are able to see their 24 hr stories, posts, and lives. In addition, they can also start group chats and individually message them as well.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
Limitations that could be improved is that many of these popular social media apps only have one focal purpose. This results in users having to download multiple apps and re-add the same individuals. I believe that adding more features and giving the users an option of which features(interests) they could choose would give the app a feeling of personalization.

# Step 2: Target Users ✔️
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 

# Step 3: Pick a Qualitative Research Method
