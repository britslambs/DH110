This space is for my UX project about family. 


  
# Step 1: Specify the Research Goal & Requirements  ✔️
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity my project would support for the users is being able to connect with family members beyond messaging. This would mean that they would be able to share an interest(s) of their choice. For example, if one family chose music or movies as their interest, they could share recommendations and live stream the song or movie with each other.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
A basic need that is involved for the activity is belonging/love. Because this app this made for family members or close individuals, users would be able to bond and feel deep connections with the people they love. While people can text or call each other, this app allows them to keep updated with all of their loved ones despite varying schedules. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Traditional/current solutions to statisfy these needs are social media apps such as Instagram and Facebook. Users are able to search and follow/friend users. By doing so, they are able to see their 24 hr stories, posts, and lives. In addition, they can also start group chats and individually message them as well.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
Limitations that could be improved is that many of these popular social media apps only have one focal purpose. This results in users having to download multiple apps and re-add the same individuals. I believe that adding more features and giving the users an option of which features(interests) they could choose would give the app a feeling of personalization.

# Step 2: Target Users ✔️
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
I want to create a website that all members of a family could use, regardless of age and technological expertise. Specifically, I had in mind a college student or a member that lives further away that can easily provide their family with updates that would not get lose in text messages or emails. This app idea is not niche, therefore, it would be created in hopes of being mainstream. 
### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
Users would do this activity on a weekly basis, updating their close network of loved ones with any life updates or new recommendations such as music, tv shows, recipes, etc. Ideally, users would be able to use this app on desktop or mobile.
### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users can easily post life updates, link videos, and share interests.

# Step 3: Pick a Qualitative Research Method
I plan to collect information with my participant over a recorded Zoom interview. I chose two methods for collecting data: participatory observation and interview. Within the interview I asked questions within the following sections:

**1.Introduction/Background Information** 
I provided the participant with an introduction about what this user research was about. I then began to ask questions regarding how they connect social media with their relationships in the lives such as family members and close friends.


**2.Contextual Inquiry/Activities**
I asked the user to perform certain tasks on websites that would allow streaming/music sharing with other users since this falls into one of the interest that families can pick on my proposed app. The participant did this activity in his home, a place where he usually takes the time to reach out and connect with his loved ones. During the task, he was instructed to think aloud and walk me through these tasks through his perspective.

**3.Problem Questions**
Next, I asked him about any issues he faced while doing the tasks on the websites of his choosing. In addition, I wanted insight from him regarding any general issues he faces when trying to stay in communication with family members.

**4.Closing Questions**
The last questions were follow up questions on his user opinion and any lingering thoughts he had at the end of the interview.

# Insights ✔️
I was able to gain some very interesting points from the participatory observation and interview:

1) Question: What do you like to share with your family and friends? Are there any particular categories of interest that you like to share with others? 
   
   >"In terms of interest, family and friends would be divided into two different groups. The family would be just either talking about other family or just major life events like, "oh, got a new job", or "oh, did you hear what's going on with your cousin" or something. Friends, I just talked to them either about making plans to go meet outside or stuff like common interests like memes or games or music or movies, stuff like that. More like pop culture things, I guess."
 
  *His response was very insightful as he pointed out that there is a difference in what he shares with friends and family. I wanted to know these to understand what priorities should be on a family-centered app. Popular social media apps today blend both together (families and friends), while I want to create an app that is useful for families and could help them further connect with each other by starting to share interests with each other that they maybe haven't shared before.*
   
2) Question: Do you like sharing media that you enjoy with others? And if so, what type of media? 

   >"Yeah, it sort of just depends on the circle of people because I do have good friends that I know that even though we're close and everything, I know we don't align a lot in some of our interests. So if I'm interested in sort of a video game or a piece of music that I'm really cool with, there's some people I'll share with and others that I wouldn't. So like the last question answered it's more based on per person kind of thing."
   
   *The participant expresses that he likes to share certain interests with people and not others. This was helpful because a direct message/interesting sharing feature could be a desired feature for users. In addition, his mention of video games also gives me an idea of adding a Gaming interest category that could have both mobile games and desktop games as subcategories to dicuss and share.*
    
3) Question: What features of a website like this would you look for such as sharing features or like a chat box? 
   
     >"Yeah, I mean some sort of chat box or video in or voice call, something like that that's already integrated in like I already mentioned before, I had issues with the discord live streaming. So I'd like
for the live stream to not be so choppy and for that to actually work properly. So those would be some of the things I would like to look into. Of course, also I wouldn't want to download anything that we would have extensive ads or something that would ruin the whole viewing experience that I want to start."

*His response was very thoughtful as he mentions that having chatbox and voice call features would be his priorities when looking for a movie/show streaming website. After hearing this, I know to priortize this when creating my movie sharing feature. In addition, if my app needed to run ads, it would be important to run them periodically to not inconvenient the user and cause them to move to a different app.*

4) Question: Would you find it convenient if this feature or this music sharing aspect was integrated into another app such as messenger or Instagram? 

     >"To an extent, maybe. Messenger and Instagram don't really have any foothold in music. They're more just either for direct messaging each other or images. So I feel like trying to tack on an extra music social part of each of them would kind of just clutter the app and I don't think would make sense in my opinion. I just like to see Spotify just expand its sort of repertoire to include more of a social interaction between users." 
     
*This is an interesting response because I expected his answer be "Yes". However, it emphasized the minimalistic importance of an app when he said that adding too many features would "clutter the app". Therefore, I have to prioritize the amount of interest categories to put in my app design in order to not overwhelm the user. Overall, this was a wake up call for me as I was very ambitious in creating interest categories prior to conducting this interview.*
 

# Reflection ✔️
  
  This user research process felt a lot more natural than the Pilot Testing because it was more of a conversation. Therefore, my results are more informative and allowed me to step into the position of my participant more naturally. My participant belonged to a different demographic compared to my UT. My previous participant is a 21 year old, third-year UCLA student while my participant for user research is a 26 year old, working man. Now, I am able to have the perspective of two very different individuals and their values of connecting with friends and family members. Also, this participant was more talkative as he walked me through each step of performing the tasks and explained to me in detail regarding his opinions of current social media apps and methods of communicating. 
  
  Throughout the interview, I found myself having to change my script questions a little bit, which was expected. However, I was able to follow along my script relatively closely. 
  
  A memorable insight during this interview was when I asked if he would find it convenient if music/movie sharing features were integrated in the current apps he uses. While I expected him to say "yes", he mentions that it only be appropriate to a certain extent and would make sense on some apps compared to others. He mentions that it could also cause the app to be too cluttered. This was a very humbling statement to hear as it has caused me to reassess my priorties when creating the app design since I had previously planned to have categories and subcategories. 
  
  If I had the opportunity to re-do this research or further it, I would create more elaborate tasks and less background/introduction questions. Another aspect of my user research that I would want to change is having this interview conducted in-person instead of Zoom. Because my participant did not have a webcam on his computer, he was limited to showing me his process of completing these tasks through his phone. Overall, I found this experience super informative since it was my first time carrying out user research and I was also able to further understand the position of the user. This will definitely be helpful when creating user personas.
