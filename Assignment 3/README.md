This space is for my UX project about family. 


  
# Step 1: Specify the Research Goal & Requirements  ✔️
### What is the main activity your project would support for the users?
The main activity my project would support for the users is being able to connect with family members beyond messaging. This would mean that they would be able to share an interest(s) of their choice. For example, if one family chose music or movies as their interest, they could share recommendations and live stream the song or movie with each other.
### What is the basic need/goal involved for that activity?
A basic need that is involved for the activity is belonging/love. Because this app this made for family members or close individuals, users would be able to bond and feel deep connections with the people they love. While people can text or call each other, this app allows them to keep updated with all of their loved ones despite varying schedules. 
### What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?
Traditional/current solutions to statisfy these needs are social media apps such as Instagram and Facebook. Users are able to search and follow/friend users. By doing so, they are able to see their 24 hr stories, posts, and lives. In addition, they can also start group chats and individually message them as well.
### What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved?
Limitations that could be improved is that many of these popular social media apps only have one focal purpose. This results in users having to download multiple apps and re-add the same individuals. I believe that adding more features and giving the users an option of which features(interests) they could choose would give the app a feeling of personalization.

# Step 2: Target Users ✔️
### What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise, mainstream vs. extreme) 
I want to create a website that all members of a family could use, regardless of age and technological expertise. Specifically, I had in mind a college student or a member that lives further away that can easily provide their family with updates that would not get lose in text messages or emails. This app idea is not niche, therefore, it would be created in hopes of being mainstream. 
### In which context (where, why, under which conditions) would the users do that activity? 
Users would do this activity on a weekly basis, updating their close network of loved ones with any life updates or new recommendations such as music, tv shows, recipes, etc. Ideally, users would be able to use this app on desktop or mobile.
### What would the users usually do in order to complete that activity? 
Users can easily post life updates, link videos, and share interests.

# Step 3: Pick a Qualitative Research Method
I plan to collect information with my participant over a recorded Zoom interview. Within the interview I asked questions within the following sections:

**1.Introduction/Background Information** 
I provided the participant with an introduction about what this user research was about. I then began to ask questions regarding how they connect social media with their relationships in the lives such as family members and close friends.


**2.Contextual Inquiry/Activties**
I asked the user to perform certain tasks on websites that would allow streaming/music sharing with other users since this falls into one of the interest that families can pick on my proposed app. The participant did this activity in his home, a place where he usually takes the time to reach out and connect with his loved ones. During the task, he was instructed to think aloud and walk me through these tasks through his perspective.

**3.Problem Questions**
Next, I asked him about any issues he faced while doing the tasks on the websites of his choosing. In addition, I wanted insight from him regarding any general issues he faces when trying to stay in communication with family members.

**4.Closing Questions**
The last questions were follow up questions on his user opinion and any lingering thoughts he had at the end of the interview.
