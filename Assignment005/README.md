# Assignment 6: Interface Design
## Description
The purpose of this design is to create a minimalistic interface for my app idea: Branches. It is a family-centric app that aims to maintain and grow close relationships, even from a distance. In this app, families can chat, video call, post updates, play games, and stream movies together. I chose to design the home page of the app that shows updates from family members and icons at the bottom of the screen which can lead you to the other features previously mentioned. My design process started off with my hand-drawn low-fidelity prototypes and refining them when I started creating the interface on Figma. In addition, the home page is also created from the perspective of one of my personas, Claire Smith.

##  Impression 
### User #1: Margaret
I asked my user participant, Margaret, on how she felt about my designs and her first immediate thoughts after seeing it from the first time, these are her following thoughts:
* "The app looks clean but the design is pretty simple"
* "I definitely prefer light mode since the dark mode is kind-of hard to read"
* "I think the screenshot all the way to the right has the best font"
* "The font size is pretty easy to read"
* "The middle screenshot has the best shape-roundness in my opinion. The one all the way to the right is too rounded and cuts off the picture"


### Findings
*Typography* : The user found that the Lexand (Sans Serif) font is the easiest to read. This deviates from my own opinion that Lato is the most suitable for this app design. But this definitely made me re-think what the appropriate font would be. I would like to do further testing and surveying on this aspect of my interface design.

*Shapes* : The user preferred the corner radius of 10. This also differed from my own opinion since I feel like more rounded the corners are, the less you can see the images. However, I believe that the search and post buttons can have a different corner radius than the image box.

*Color* : I definitely expected that the user would prefer the light mode. I can see now that the dark mode color is not ideal and as visually pleasing as I want it to be. This is definitely something I need to work on because many people prefer dark mode when using apps, including myself.

### User #2: Alex
Recording:

### Findings
* User found that wireframe is good and that features are "reasonably spaced"
* Font is legible and readable, user belives that the middle text (Montagu Slab) is the best
* However, for the second screenshot in the typographic variation, he found that the text is cluttered with the features. Also, sees this problem in the app title and icon to have this issue
* User prefers the shape variation with the roundest corner radius, finds it "easy on the eyes" compared to sharpest edges. User believes that image box should have more of a shadow to differentiate between background and image.
* He believes that both light and dark mode should be put inside the app for user preference.

* Background Color: F6F5EA
* Font Color: 000000
* Button Color: E1DEDE

### Layout Grid
* Rows: 4
* Columns: 5
* Gutter: 20 (for both)

### Typeface
* Header: Lato (Sans Serif), Bold, Size 36
* (Got a thought?) Button: Lato, Light, Size 20
* User names of post: Lato, Regular, Size 20
* Minutes uploaded caption: Lato, Light, Size 15

### Typographic Variations
From left to right in the screenshot: Lato, Montagu Slab (Slab Serif), and Lexend (Sans Serif)
* Level of font boldness and size is the same as the Typeface section above, regardless of typographic variation

### Shape Variations
* From left to right in the screenshot, the corner radius to create different levels of roundness are 5, 10, and 20.

## Design Decisions

### Typeface
I chose Lato because it is simple, elegant, and legible, the characteristics I wanted my app design to follow. However, after doing the typography variations, I think Montagu Slab could also be a great option since it is a more friendly-looking font. Overall, I think Lato is a safe choice but I still would like to continue looking for fonts that have a balance of seriousness and friendliness.

### Color Scheme
My color scheme is black, gray, and cream. I chose these colors because it has a good color contrast and allows for the text to be legible. In addition, since these colors are very calm and neutral, the user won't be visually overwhelmed and distracted from completing their desired tasks.

### Layout Grid
My layout grid is 4 rows and 5 columns because I believe that the spacing between the features are at a distance that allows users to easily differentiate between various functions.
