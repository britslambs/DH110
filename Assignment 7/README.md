# High Fidelity Prototype
## Description of Project
My project focuses on creating a family-centric app that allows individuals to connect with their loved ones through posting updates, private messaging, video chatting, gaming, and video streaming. Because there is so much clutter on social media these days, this app gives its users privacy and combines functions that are found in different social media apps. This assignment focuses on revising and improving my interface design while also including an interactive wireflow and prototype. 
## Purpose
The purpose of a hi-fi prototype is to create realistic user interactions. It is the closest opportunity for the designer to use the app as a user would. It usually represents the close-end product of the app design and is used to test specific components.  
## Process
## Tasks
 ### Task 1: Creating an update post
 
### Task 2: Streaming a movie with others
## Wireflow with Graphic Design
