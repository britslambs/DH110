# High Fidelity Prototype
## Description of Project
My project focuses on creating a family-centric app that allows individuals to connect with their loved ones through posting updates, private messaging, video chatting, gaming, and video streaming. Because there is so much clutter on social media these days, this app gives its users privacy and combines functions that are found in different social media apps. This assignment focuses on revising and improving my interface design while also including an interactive wireflow and prototype. 
## Purpose
The purpose of a hi-fi prototype is to create realistic user interactions. It is the closest opportunity for the designer to use the app as a user would. It usually represents the close-end product of the app design and is used to test specific components.  
## Process
## Tasks
 ### Task 1: Creating an update post
 > In the first task, the user is going through the process of posting an update for their family to see. In this process, they are using the caption, photo, and location feature components. To do so, they will write a caption, add a photo of their food from their camera, add their location, and finally share it on their feed. 
 
### Task 2: Streaming a movie with others
> In the second task, the user is doing the task of streaming a movie with their family member. To do so, they will be using the movie streaming feature. After they click on the icon at the bottom of the screen, they will create a room, add their family member, name the room, choose a streaming platform, pick a movie, start streaming, and utilize the chat feature during their viewing.

*Task 2*: https://www.figma.com/proto/aL0VJQDkYHhY6JHVzTSiTR/Hi-Fi-Prototype-Assignment-Task-2?type=design&node-id=7-132&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=7%3A132 

## Cognitive Walkthrough

#### What do you see on the home screen?

#### What do you think the app is about?

#### What do you think this app is used for?

#### Is there any point that the users may not understand? 
	 
	* Answer for Task 1:
	* Answer for Task 2:

#### Is there any point in the app that the users may feel lost and not sure how to continue or go back?

#### Is there anything missing, confusing, or inconsistent? 

#### Any other comments?

## Refined Prototypes
*User Testing Task 1*: https://www.figma.com/proto/aL0VJQDkYHhY6JHVzTSiTR/Hi-Fi-Prototype-Assignment-Task-2?type=design&node-id=7-132&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=7%3A132

*User Testing Task 2*:

### Findings
#### Task 1
* User expressed that the Home Page is readable, specifically mentioning the text and spacing, however, they would like to see some color on in the background
* Stated that "Got a thought" is intuitive 
* User understood all icons (universal) when going through the task of making a post
* User was able to go between pages very easily
* User believes that the location bar is too close to the "save draft" 
* He expresses that the text in the "Confirm post" should be more centered 
* Overall, believes that stylization and formatting needs a little work, flow is good

##### Revisions
* Focused on adding color and centering test and images
