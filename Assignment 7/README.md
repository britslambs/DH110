# High Fidelity Prototype
## Description of Project
My project focuses on creating a family-centric app that allows individuals to connect with their loved ones through posting updates, private messaging, video chatting, gaming, and video streaming. Because there is so much clutter on social media these days, this app gives its users privacy and combines functions that are found in different social media apps. This assignment focuses on revising and improving my interface design while also including an interactive wireflow and prototype. 
## Purpose
The purpose of a hi-fi prototype is to create realistic user interactions. It is the closest opportunity for the designer to use the app as a user would. It usually represents the close-end product of the app design and is used to test specific components.  
## Process
This high-fidelity, interactive prototype involved several processes. Firstly, I based my wireflow off of my hand-drawn, low-fidelity wireframes. After evaluating my inital designs again, I might slight changes, mainly in the placement of my button features to make the flow more intuitive for users. In addition to my re-designs, I used the plug-in AutoFlow to map out how I would want to create my prototype flows. Then, after creating my prototypes, I entered the user-testing stage. The user was able to give valuable insight on ease of task, stylization and formatting of app, and the overall look and feel of the design. Therefore, I was able to take these critiques and revise my prototypes.

## Tasks
 ### Task 1: Creating an update post
 > In the first task, the user is going through the process of posting an update for their family to see. In this process, they are using the caption, photo, and location feature components. To do so, they will write a caption, add a photo of their food from their camera, add their location, and finally share it on their feed. 
 
### Task 2: Streaming a movie with others
> In the second task, the user is doing the task of streaming a movie with their family member. To do so, they will be using the movie streaming feature. After they click on the icon at the bottom of the screen, they will create a room, add their family member, name the room, choose a streaming platform, pick a movie, start streaming, and utilize the chat feature during their viewing.

## Cognitive Walkthrough
## User 1: Margaret 
#### What do you see on the home screen?
> I see a search function, the ability to create a post, a social media feed, and several icons below which have different functions.

#### What do you think the app is about?
> It is a social media app where I can share things about my life, but also speak to other people using the app’s functions. I can also stream video with other users. 

#### What do you think this app is used for?
> This app is for keeping up to date with friends and family while also socializing with them. I can also post about my own life as well. 

#### Is there any point that the users may not understand? 
	 
> Answer for Task 1: The process of creating a post is very simple and straightforward.
> Answer for Task 2: At the “Let’s Stream” part, there is a history section on that page. Users may believe they can completely rewatch a movie with the same people previously. For example, can I rewatch the Titanic with the exact same friends and family previously? If not then, why is it in the same tab with room creation?

#### Is there any point in the app that the users may feel lost and not sure how to continue or go back?
> I believe the app has a very streamlined and easy to understand process to go back, since there is a back arrow during every process. Continuing with the app’s processes is mostly easy to follow, however, there are several different ways to progress in the app. These different ways include clicking on an arrow, next button, creating a room name, etc. There is no uniform way for continuing like there is with going back. 

#### Is there anything missing, confusing, or inconsistent? 
> The create a post and confirm post tables for Task 1 are confusing since they share the same process of typing, editing, and finalizing a social media post. These tabs should be merged into a single edit and share tab.

#### Any other comments?
> I would recommend looking into how you can further personalize each user’s experience with this app. For movie streaming, a playlist generated on user analytics would be helpful. On making posts, sets of premade photo edit choices could be saved so the user could reuse their preferred settings. This app has a very user friendly interface and is intuitive to use as well, but a user personalized experience would make it stand out. 

### Cognitive Walkthrough Findings
This user was able to go through the prototypes very smoothly for the post part. Their critiques are in the edit and confirm pages in the task of uploading a post. In addition, they find the "Last Movies Watched" feature confusing on the streaming page. Lastly, they suggest that a playlist of suggested movies could be a good addition to the app. I found these findings very insightful as even though I believed some of the features were intuitive, the user might not. Therefore, this process of user testing has been very helpful. After considering their critiques, I believe they are very valid and would serve was great additions to the app.

## User Testing/Revisions

* User expressed that the Home Page is readable, specifically mentioning the text and spacing, however, they would like to see some color on in the background
* Stated that "Got a thought" is intuitive 
* User understood all icons (universal) when going through the task of making a post
* User was able to go between pages very easily
* User believes that the location bar is too close to the "save draft" 
* He expresses that the text in the "Confirm post" should be more centered 
* Overall, believes that stylization and formatting needs a little work, flow is good

#### Revisions
* Focused on adding color and centering text and images

## Reflection
Overall, this process was both difficult and enjoyable at the same time. Since it was my first time creating a Hi-Fi prototype, I was not only learning how to use Figma but also attempting to create a user-friendly app while considering how to implement the characteristics of good design. Going through the iterative design process was very insightful as I also learned what my strengths and weaknesses are as a designer and what stages of design I struggle with most. However, I was able to use my creativity and brought my idea that I created in Week 2/3 to life. In addition, the process of user-testing at every stage has been very helpful as I could see the perspective of potential real-life users. They were able to identify blind spots and mistakes that I missed as a designer.
